# 1. Algorithm for Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

# Step 1: Start
# Step 2: Display game rules (Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, Paper beats Rock).
# Step 3: Prompt the user to select their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
# Step 4: Generate a random choice for the computer.
# Step 5: Compare the user’s choice and the computer’s choice:
#         - If user choice == computer choice, it’s a tie.
#         - If user choice beats computer choice, user wins.
#         - Otherwise, computer wins.
# Step 6: Display the result (Winner or Tie).
# Step 7: Ask if the user wants to play again.
# Step 8: Repeat the game if the user chooses to continue.
# Step 9: End
