# 2. Algorithm for Automating File Operations

# Step 1: Start
# Step 2: Display a menu for file operations:
#         1. Copy File
#         2. Move File
#         3. Rename File
#         4. Delete File
# Step 3: Take user input for the operation choice.
# Step 4: Based on the choice:
#         - If Copy, prompt for source and destination paths and execute the copy command.
#         - If Move, prompt for source and destination paths and execute the move command.
#         - If Rename, prompt for old and new file names and execute the rename command.
#         - If Delete, prompt for file name and execute the delete command.
# Step 5: Display success message.
# Step 6: End
