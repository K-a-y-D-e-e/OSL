1. Operating System (OS) Overview

An Operating System (OS) is system software that manages hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

Functions of OS:

    Process Management: Manages processes in a system (creation, scheduling, termination).
    Memory Management: Allocates/deallocates memory and ensures efficient memory use.
    File System Management: Manages data storage, retrieval, and organization of files.
    Device Management: Controls peripheral devices using device drivers.
    Security and Access Control: Protects data and system resources from unauthorized access.
    User Interface: Provides a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI).

2. Benefits of Linux-based OS vs. Windows-based OS

    Cost: Linux is free; Windows requires a license.
    Open Source: Linux allows modifications; Windows is proprietary.
    Security: Linux is less prone to malware.
    Customization: Linux provides more flexibility for users.
    Performance: Linux is lightweight and efficient, especially for servers.
    Package Management: Linux uses package managers for software installation and updates.
