# 1. Definition of Shell Scripting
# Shell scripting is a program written for the shell, or command line interpreter, of an operating system.
# It automates tasks by executing a sequence of commands in a script file.

# Arithmetic Operations and Their Shell Script Representation

# | **Operation**   | **Symbol** | **Shell Script Representation**      |
# |-----------------|------------|--------------------------------------|
# | Addition        | +          | result=$((num1 + num2))             |
# | Subtraction     | -          | result=$((num1 - num2))             |
# | Multiplication  | *          | result=$((num1 * num2))             |
# | Division        | /          | result=$((num1 / num2))             |
# | Modulus         | %          | result=$((num1 % num2))             |
# | Exponentiation  | **         | result=$((num1 ** num2)) (bash 4.0+) |

# 2. Algorithm to Perform Basic Arithmetic Operations

# Step 1: Start
# Step 2: Prompt the user to enter two numbers (num1, num2).
# Step 3: Display options for the operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).
# Step 4: Take user input for the operation choice.
# Step 5: Perform the selected operation using the input numbers.
# Step 6: Display the result.
# Step 7: End

# 3. Shell Program for Basic Arithmetic Operations

# Prompt the user for input
echo "Enter the first number:"
read num1

echo "Enter the second number:"
read num2

echo "Select an operation:"
echo "1. Addition"
echo "2. Subtraction"
echo "3. Multiplication"
echo "4. Division"
read choice

# Perform the operation based on user choice
case $choice in
  1)
    result=$((num1 + num2))
    echo "Result of Addition: $result"
    ;;
  2)
    result=$((num1 - num2))
    echo "Result of Subtraction: $result"
    ;;
  3)
    result=$((num1 * num2))
    echo "Result of Multiplication: $result"
    ;;
  4)
    if [ $num2 -ne 0 ]; then
      result=$((num1 / num2))
      echo "Result of Division: $result"
    else
      echo "Error: Division by zero is not allowed."
    fi
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Invalid choice. Please select a valid option."
    ;;
